# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
A minimal Streamlit application that displays "Hello World" when launched. Primary goal is to establish the repository structure and conventions for future enhancements.

## 2. Goals
- One-command run experience
- Proper git hygiene with secrets excluded
- Foundation for logging and configuration

## 3. Non-Goals
- Complex UI/UX
- Data integrations
- Authentication

## 4. Users and Use Cases
- Developer validating environment setup
- Stakeholders verifying initial scaffolding

## 5. Requirements
- App displays exactly: Hello World
- Start with: `streamlit run app.py`
- `.gitignore` includes `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and common Python ignores
- Repo includes minimal docs and dependency file

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- Running the app shows the text "Hello World"
- No untracked noise files appear after typical runs
- Repo contains docs, `.gitignore`, and `requirements.txt`

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- Streamlit version incompatibility → pin a known-stable version
- Secrets leakage → ensure `.streamlit/secrets.toml` is gitignored

## 8. Release Plan
- Single initial commit; no feature flags
