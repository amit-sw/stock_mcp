# Requirements Document

## Summary
Set up a basic Streamlit app that renders the text "Hello World". Include a .gitignore that ignores .streamlit/secrets.toml and common Python artifacts.

## Functional Requirements
- Display a single line of text: Hello World
- App runs with `streamlit run app.py`

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Simple, easy-to-read code
- Configurable logging (level and destination) prepared for future use
- Clear project structure
- Version-controlled with proper .gitignore (including `.streamlit/secrets.toml`)

## Deliverables
- Minimal Streamlit app entrypoint (`app.py`)
- `.gitignore` with Python and Streamlit secrets entries
- `requirements.txt` with Streamlit 
- Documentation kept in sync

## Out of Scope (for now)
- Authentication, secrets usage
- CI/CD
- Testing suite
- Theming and complex UI
